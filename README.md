# Dotfiles

This is the repository for all of my dotfiles for Linux/OSX. It uses [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to organize the configuration files, and follows the [XDG Base Directory specification](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/XDG_Base_Directory) to keep my home (`~`) directory as clean as possible.

## Installation

To install these dotfiles onto a new system, clone this repository to `~/.config/dotfiles`:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:zaknesler/dotfiles.git ~/.config/dotfiles
```

Now you can run the `install.sh` file.
